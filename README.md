# Stateless React Katas

A repository for practicing converting HTML to React and JSX.

### Getting Started

Install node, if you haven't already.

```no-highlight
$ git clone https://github.com/LaunchAcademy/stateless_react_katas.git
$ cd stateless_react_katas
$ npm install -g webpack-dev-server
$ npm install
$ webpack-dev-server
```

Point your browser to <http://localhost:8080/index.html>.

### Write some React

Inside `src/index.html` we have a few snippets of HTML which we would like for
you to convert to React.

`src/main.js` contains a "Hello World" react component example. Use this, and the
[React docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html) as your guide.
